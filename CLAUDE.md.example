# Example CLAUDE.md Configuration for Voice Mode

Add this section to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file to enable automatic voice responses from Claude Code.

```markdown
## Voice Mode - Automatic Speech

**You have access to automatic voice output via Claude Voice TTS system.**

### Voice Mode Control

**Check if voice mode is enabled:**
```bash
[ -f ~/.config/tts-service/voice_mode ] && echo "enabled" || echo "disabled"
```

**Enable/Disable voice mode:**
```bash
tts voice-mode on           # Enable with default voice (af_bella)
tts voice-mode off          # Disable
tts voice-mode status       # Check current status
```

**Change voice:**
```bash
tts voice-mode voice am_adam       # Male voice
tts voice-mode voice af_sky        # Female voice
```

### Auto-Speak Integration

**When voice mode is enabled**, automatically speak your responses:

```bash
tts-auto-speak "Your response text here"
```

The `tts-auto-speak` command:
- Checks `~/.config/tts-service/voice_mode` file
- If voice mode is enabled, generates and plays speech
- If disabled, exits silently (no-op)
- Automatically uses the voice specified in the state file

**Available voices:**
- Female: af_bella, af_sky, af_nicole, af_sarah, af_nova, bf_emma, bf_lily, af_jessica, af_river, af_heart
- Male: am_adam, am_michael, am_liam, am_eric, bm_george, bm_lewis, am_onyx, am_echo, bm_daniel, am_fenrir

### Usage Pattern

After completing tasks or providing important information, speak the response:

```bash
# Example: After completing a build
if [ -f ~/.config/tts-service/voice_mode ]; then
    tts-auto-speak "Build completed successfully with no errors."
fi
```

**IMPORTANT**: When voice mode is enabled, call `tts-auto-speak` with your key responses to provide audible feedback. This creates a more interactive experience.

### Example Integration

```bash
# In your script or after a command
if some_command; then
    echo "Command succeeded"
    tts-auto-speak "Command succeeded"
else
    echo "Command failed"
    tts-auto-speak "Command failed with error"
fi
```
```

## Installation

Copy the relevant section above into your project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file to enable voice mode awareness for Claude Code.
